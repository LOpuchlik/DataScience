# PandasProfilingApp
Acknowledgements: I got inspired to write this app by an excellent youtuber: DataProfessor.

This is a streamlit app project for profiling datasets in pandas.
There are two options of uploading a dataset:
1) loading a custom dataset from a local file
2) choosing one of three example datasets: iris, titanic or boston housing
